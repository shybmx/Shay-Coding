        I am currently studying computer science at City University of London; I am someone who enjoys programming constantly and would love to do it as a living. I have only started programming in 2014 when I have started university; within my first two weeks we were instructed to complete a java boot camp, this is where we would program in the language for two weeks straight and by the end produce something. By the end of the two weeks I have created a drawing panel that allows the users to select the colours and free draw on a blank canvas. After coding my first couple of lines I started to enjoy it and wanted to pursue it as a career.

            In my spare time I am doing one of several things. Playing video games, watching youtube videos or just sleeping. I enjoy a wide range of games but at the moment the one that I am playing the most is <a target="_blank" href="http://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=shybmx">League Of Legends</a>. I do occasionally play something else such as Left 4 Dead, Team Fortress 2 or even Pokémon. I enjoy playing video games and have a huge collection; this is what has gotten me into computer science. I was always interested in looking at the codes in video games and tried to figure out what they do. Now that I have knowledge on a few programming languages I can figure out what they are doing and mod them to my own liking.

        I am a huge fan of Esports and that is one reason why I love playing games such as League Of Legends or Pokémon; where you can have a simple concept for a game but people can do complex things within it and make it into a sport. I am currently supporting the League Of Legends team Fnatic who plays in the EU LCS.

        Whilst studying in GCSE and A-Level I was studying photograph, Maths with mechanics and IT; I have a passion about the art form and still enjoy taking photographs today. Because of this I feel that this have improved my programming skills, it makes me think about everything in an abstract manner. It makes me think about how I would do something differently and what I could do to improve it. The maths skills that I have gained allow me to think critically in situations, they allow me to solve problems in a fast manner and complete it with minimal errors.

          Currently I have 2 machines on which I am typing code on. A Dell insprion 17 and an IMac 2010, I normally carry around my laptop to type code on the go and then once I am home transfer everything onto my mac to carry on typing. I also use my mac for designing projects on Photoshop; the use of both operating systems helps me a lot on coding to see how they affect 2 different systems.
