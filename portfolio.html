            <p>
            Mauritian nights is a website that I have created for a client based in Mauritius. I have coded the site in HTML and CSS using the knowledge that I have learnt in the first year at university. The website is client based; I have met the requirements that they have asked me to produces and then have pushed it out to the public. Whilst coding this site I have learnt more on website design, programming and testing.

            For this project I had created a video game coding everything in Java, this was set from my University; I have used assets from various video games and have imported it into the game. The purpose of this project was to create a video game in ten weeks and this is after I have just started learning Java. We have used the engine called Jbox2D and the City University one provided to help create it.

            This is currently an ongoing project; here I am trying to create a soundboard for a video game called League of legends. In this application the user can select a character then choose what sound they want to produce. This is a personal project that I am working on at my free time.

             In my second year at University I have started to program in C++, and our first coursework that we had to be completed was to create a phone book. We worked in groups to help one another complete the task; there were several task that had to be complete such as: allow user to input a name and surname, with E-Mail and phone number, sort the phone book in alphabetical order and search for a contact.
